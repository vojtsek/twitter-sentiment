@Beancounter823 @UnitedBrews it's obvious that you respect my opinion less because of my age. Just being reasonably defensive.
@realDonaldTrump Thank you Mr.President, I'm not Deplorable nor is any of our American People, thank you for ending corrupt @HillaryClinton
@WillieAtFLO well with @jasonmbryant and @CPyles8 recommendation I should do the opposite of your pick to win? Haha... thanks for the help!
